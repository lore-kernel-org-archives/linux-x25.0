Thanks for the reminder. I have definitely waited too long before revisiting
this series, and only had a vague recollection of that discussion but could
not find it in the logs (found it now, and the Link I quoted...).

I would prefer to get this series into the coming merge window, and
probably don't have time to rework it completely by then, so I hope
the current version is ok.

I also found your comment on lock_sock(), which could be easily
added inside of sock_gettstamp() if you think we should have that.
There is one more issue I just noticed (I dropped the necessary
sock_read_timestamp()), so I have to repost the series anyway
to fix that.
