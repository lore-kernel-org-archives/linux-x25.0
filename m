Absolutely. This is a great simplification either way.

To remind, the issue is that sock_enable_timestamp should update both
sk_flags and net_enable_timestamp as one atomic operation, by holding
the socket lock. The lock is held when called from a setsockopt path.
And from some ioctl() implementations. The syzkaller reproducer
triggered through inet_release, so the most widely used paths are
buggy today.

Since the current state is inconsistent already, we can defer the fix.
I expect that it is now safe to add a lock around this logic without
triggering lockdep issues in any of the numerous paths. But just in
case, it still seems safer to do that in a separate patch that we can
revert or rework independent from this, if that would prove necessary.

Instead of reading sk->sk_stamp directly? Yes, makes sense.
