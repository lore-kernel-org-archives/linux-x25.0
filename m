Yes, although that can also be a separate follow-on patch. The
patch as is better matches the existing behavior of the majority
of protocols.

These probably only use cmsgs SCM_TIMESTAMP(NS|IMG)
to read timestamps.

Yes, that's a nice solution. There is always some risk in changing
error codes. But ioctl callers should be able to support newly
implemented functionality. Even if partially implemented and
returning ENOENT instead of ENOIOCTLCMD.
