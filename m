I suppose it would be best to always take that lock then, rather than
removing the lock as my patch does at the moment.

I thought about that as well, but I could not come up with a
good way to encode the difference between socket protocols
that allow timestamping and those that don't.

I think ideally we would just call sock_gettstamp() unconditonally
on every socket, and have that function decide whether timestamps
make sense or not. The part I did not understand is which ones
actually want the timestamps or not. Most protocols that
implement the ioctls also assign skb->tstamp, but there are some
protocols in which I could not see skb->tstamp ever being set,
and some that set it but don't seem to have the ioctls.

Looking at it again, it seems that sock_gettstamp() should
actually deal with this gracefully: it will return a -EINVAL
error condition if the timestamp remains at the
SK_DEFAULT_STAMP initial value, which is probably
just as appropriate (or better) as the current -ENOTTY
default, and if we are actually recording timestamps, we
might just as well report them.
