Good point. FWIW, I have discussed with Deepa how those should
be modified for y2038, but we don't have any current patches for
those.

Ok, so do you think we should stay with the current version
for now, and change the two points later, or should I rework
it to integrate the locking and removing the callback?

I suppose the series actually gets nicer without the
callback, since I can simply add the generic timestamping
implementation first, and then remove the dead ioctl
handlers.
